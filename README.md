# Titanic Research


## Introduction

Here is my introduction. include source of data here (where/who/if have legal permission to use)
1. I have always been fascinated with history, the Titanic included. I was excited when I found this data source on the list and knew that it would be a great option to study (my other final choice was fossils, once again, history). I somewhat assumed the general answers to my questions, but I thought it would be fun to test myself by coding the ___ to find the exact answers.
2. The questions that I attempted to answer with my code were:
  1. Is there a trend between ticket fare and survival? If so, what are the different survival rates for more expensive tickets vs. less expensive tickets?
  2. Is there a trend between gender and survival? If so, what are the exact survival rates of female vs. male?


## Methods

Here are my Methods.
1. Dataset: describe how data was generated (what i know), who owns it, why am i able to use it
2. Process: self explanatory
3. Challenges: having to disregard empty strings/tokens, account for quotes in tokens, cut to two decimals

## Results and Conclusion

Here is what I found.
1. What does data show/what are takeaways? Plots might be helpful (questions dependent)
2. What are some related or additional questions that you would like to explore granted more time/resources?
